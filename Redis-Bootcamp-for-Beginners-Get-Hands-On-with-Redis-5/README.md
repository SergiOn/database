GETRANGE mykey 0 3 (Returns the substring of the string value stored at key).

GETRANGE mykey -3 -1. (-1 means the last character and so on).

SETEX mykey 10 "Hello" (Set key to hold the string value and set key to timeout after a given number of seconds.)

PSETEX mykey 1000 "Hello" ( expire time is specified in milliseconds instead of seconds.)

STRLEN mykey ( Returns the length of the string ).
```


### List Command Cheat Sheet

```bash
RPUSH mylist "hello" (Insert all the specified values at the tail of the list stored at key.)

LRANGE mylist 0 -1 (Returns the specified elements of the list stored at key.)

LPUSH mylist "world" (Insert all the specified values at the head of the list stored at key.)

RPUSHX mylist "World" (Inserts value at the tail of the list stored at key, only if key already exists and holds a list.)

LPUSH mylist "World" (Inserts value at the head of the list stored at key, only if key already exists and holds a list.)

RPOP mylist (Removes and returns the last element of the list stored at key.)

LPOP mylist (Removes and returns the first element of the list stored at key.)

LTRIM mylist 1 -1 (Trim an existing list so that it will contain only the specified range of elements specified)

LSET mylist 0 "four" (Sets the list element at index to value.)

LINDEX mylist 0 (Returns the element at index in the list stored at key.)

LINSERT mylist BEFORE "World" "There" (Inserts value in the list stored at key either before or after the reference value pivot.)

LLEN mylist (Returns the length of the list stored at key. )

LREM mylist 2 "hello" (Removes the first count occurrences of elements equal to value from the list stored at key.)
```


### Hashes Command Cheat Sheet

```bash
HSET myhash field1 "Hello".  (Sets field in the hash stored at key to value. If field already exists in the hash, it is overwritten.)

HGET myhash field1 (Returns the value associated with field in the hash stored at key.)


HMSET myhash field1 "Hello" field2 "World" ( Set Multiple values.)

HGETALL myhash  (Returns all fields and values of the hash stored at key.)

HMGET myhash field1 field2 (Returns the values associated with the specified fields in the hash stored at key.)

HEXISTS myhash field1 (Returns if field is an existing field in the hash stored at key.)

HKEYS myhash (Returns all field names in the hash stored at key.)

HLEN myhash (Returns the number of fields contained in the hash stored at key.)
